# Spring-Boot-Project

The Indeed Clone is a full-stack job board application built using React, Spring Boot, Hibernate, and MongoDB.

* React powers the frontend, offering a dynamic UI where users can search for jobs, view listings, and manage profiles.
* Spring Boot serves as the backend, handling business logic and providing RESTful APIs for job management, user profiles, and authentication.
* Hibernate (in conjunction with MongoDB) is used for validation, ensuring data integrity through Bean Validation annotations before data storage.
* MongoDB is the database, offering flexible schema design suitable for job postings and user profiles.
* Lombok minimizes boilerplate code, enhancing readability, while Spring Boot Developer Tools speeds up development with live reloads.
